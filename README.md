==========

An application in PHP with a web front-end to manage your food shopping with your friends easily. Don't worry about which one should pay, just enter it in the app and let it make the calculations.

# Important note

This version is not very usable as is. It was tailored to my needs and is pretty much ugly due to a bad joke with a friend :)

I'm currently working on a complete refactorization (in a separate branch) and will update the repo as soon as it is available. The new version should be easier to maintain and tweak and will be more user-friendly ! :)
