==========

An application in PHP with a web front-end to manage your food shopping with your friends easily. Don't worry about which one should pay, just enter it in the app and let it make the calculations.

# Important note

I'm currently working on a complete refactorization and will update the repo during the development. This is a WIP and the repo may not be of great interest for someone not developing it. As soon as I get a stable release, I'll update this README file to provide more infos.
